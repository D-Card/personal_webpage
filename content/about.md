Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a student at [Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/), currently studying Computer Science and Engineering. 

I'm currently working as a Systems Administrator at IST's Department of Computational Infrastructures as part of a scholarship sponsored by the FundaÃ§Ã£o para a CiÃªncia e a Tecnologia. 

I'm also part of [FST Lisboa's](https://fstlisboa.com/en/home-en/) Electronics & Software team and an instructor at [AfterSchool](https://treetree2.school/) by treetree2.

You can follow me and check some of my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/D-Card).
