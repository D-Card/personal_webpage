Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently studying Computer Science and Engineering at [Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/). 

I'm working as a Systems Administrator at IST's Department of Computational Infrastructures as part of a fellowship sponsored by the FundaÃ§Ã£o para a CiÃªncia e a Tecnologia. 

I'm also an instructor and author at [AfterSchool](https://treetree2.school/) by treetree2.

You can follow me and check some of my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/D-Card).
